GENERAL


CREATION

	If this license is used upon it when the creator creates the content, every rule in the license should be applied. Failure to do so will not result in any formal punishment, especially if they have a viable reason according to the majority of the users.

	…

APPLICATION

Method 1: Appending to said content

Method 2: Mention inside or with said content

Both methods will be discussed further in MEDIA DEFINITIONS

MODIFICATION

	If a user modifies the creator’s said content, then shares it, they will have to attribute the creator by one of their main, id est, unique identities given (exempli gratia, their full name). Failure to do so will result in the non-physical, minor punishment the creator gives to the user, unless it is mentioned in this license explicitly, as well as the user being a pirate.

SHARING

PUBLICATION

	When the creator publishes said content, users can use it if they do not use one of the methods in PIRACY, therofe pirating said content.

REMOTE SHARING

	When the creator remotely shares said content, the user or users cannot share said content unless given permission by the creator in some way.

PIRACY

Method 1: Usage of said content without this license

Method 2: Usage of said content without following the rules in MODIFICATION (even if the content wasn't modified: the rules in MODIFICATION are general enough to allow this)

DELETION

	In order for the creator to delete said content, they need to place a placeholder in the location of said content.
